session.py — ADAM v40 live-session orchestrator
==============================================================================
Owns run_session(): opens one Gemini Live connection and runs the whole
real-time robot loop as a set of cooperating asyncio tasks —

  • listen()                  — arecord mic capture, silence/noise gating, DOA
  • send()                    — forwards gated mic audio to Gemini
  • receive()                 — handles tool calls, transcripts, model audio,
                                GoAway/resumption, the refusal-loop breaker
  • speaker()                 — aplay playback + end-of-turn drain/mute logic
  • camera()                  — duty-cycled UART camera + DOA neck-tracking
  • gesture_watch()           — Touch1-4 gestures (angry/petting/STOP/song-stop)
  • wake_word_detector()      — offline Vosk: "adam" wake word during idle
                                mode, and a spoken stop phrase during songs
  • idle_watcher()            — idle conversation nudges
  • laptop_agent_healthcheck()— periodic mDNS re-verify of the laptop agent

main() drives reconnects and passes in the resumption handle; run_session()
returns the latest handle (or a ("FRESH_SESSION_REQUIRED"/"QUOTA_EXCEEDED",
handle) tuple) so main() can decide how to reconnect.

The Vosk offline wake-word model is PRELOADED once here at import — never
lazily mid-session. Loading the ~100MB+ model while the audio pipeline,
subprocesses, UART reader and camera are all live was the likely cause of
hard Pi Zero 2W reboots (OOM/brownout); doing it once up front in a quiet
moment avoids that. Only the lightweight KaldiRecognizer is created per idle
period.

tft_set is re-exported from hardware so `from session import run_session,
tft_set` keeps working for main.py. The single-element-list shared-state
boxes (_idle_mode_persistent, _play_song_requested, _doa_angle, …) are
imported BY REFERENCE from tool_handler and mutated in place ([0] = …), never
rebound — that's what lets the module-level tool handler and this session loop
see each other's writes. See tool_handler.py for the full rationale.
