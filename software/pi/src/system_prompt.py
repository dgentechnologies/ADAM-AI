system_prompt.py — ADAM v40 system-prompt builder
==============================================================================
build_system_prompt() assembles the full instruction block sent to Gemini at
the start of every session. It is rebuilt fresh on every (re)connect so the
injected date/time, memory, known faces, and recent conversation window are
always current.

Reads the live `memory`, `faces`, and `conv_log` objects from memory_store by
reference — because those are mutated in place elsewhere, this always sees the
latest state at call time. The custom prompt text (if any) is loaded from
SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE; if that file is missing, a built-in base prompt is used.
