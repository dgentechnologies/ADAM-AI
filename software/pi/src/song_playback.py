song_playback.py — ADAM v40 song/concert playback
==============================================================================
_play_song_task() plays a randomly-chosen WAV from SONG_FILE_PATHS by writing
its PCM directly into the SAME aplay process that speaker() keeps open for the
whole session — never a second competing aplay (which reliably hit ALSA
"Device or resource busy" on plughw:0,0). Runs as its own asyncio task so the
camera, servos, and Gemini send/receive keep running; only the mic is muted
for the duration. Stops when the file ends or Touch3 sets song_stop_requested.

Shared state is passed in by the caller (session.run_session) as live objects:
  • song_playing / song_stop_requested — asyncio.Event flags
  • active_speaker_proc — single-element list holding speaker()'s live Popen
  • adam_speaking — asyncio.Event (kept in the signature for parity with the
                    caller's task wiring)

    """
    Plays a randomly-chosen song from SONG_FILE_PATHS by writing its PCM
    audio directly into the SAME aplay process speaker() already has
    open — not a second competing process.

    WHY THIS APPROACH (after the previous spawn-a-second-aplay design
    repeatedly hit "Device or resource busy"): speaker() opens ONE aplay
    process that stays alive for the entire session lifetime, only
    recreated on exception/reconnect — never closed between turns. Any
    second process trying to open the same ALSA device (plughw:0,0) will
    always contend with that permanently-open first one, no matter how
    carefully timed. The only way to truly avoid the collision is to not
    open a second device handle at all — write into the one that's
    already open and working, exactly the same way Gemini's own
    converted audio chunks already do via out_q → proc.stdin.write().

    This means song files must already be in the playback format
    (48kHz stereo s16 by default) — see SONG_FILE_PATHS' comment for the
    ffmpeg conversion command. No resampling is done here; keeping this
    function simple and fast is more important than accepting arbitrary
    input formats, since resampling on a Pi Zero 2W mid-playback is
    itself a source of audible glitches.

    Runs as its own asyncio task so nothing else in the event loop is
    blocked — camera, servos, Gemini send/receive, gestures all keep
    running normally in parallel. Only the mic is muted for the duration.

    Stops on whichever comes first: the file finishing naturally, or
    song_stop_requested being set — by Touch3 during playback, or by the
    offline Vosk recogniser hearing a stop phrase (see
    wake_word_detector() in session.py, "song" duty). The voice path
    exists because Touch3 needs the ESP32-CAM UART link, and these files
    run 182-215s: with only Touch3, a dropped camera link meant ADAM
    could not be interrupted at all until the song ended.
