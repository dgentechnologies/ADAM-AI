# an omitted/empty language_codes means "automatic language detection", i.e.
# the recogniser scores the audio against 100+ languages and returns whichever
# scores highest. On clean, long utterances that works. On a SHORT fragment of
# accented Hindi it does not: measured live, real Hindi came back as Portuguese
# ("Tô com não, não") and Spanish ("peléan"), because "nahi nahi" / "karo na"
# genuinely are close phonetic matches to "não não" once a clause is only a
# second long. The downstream damage is bigger than a bad transcript: the
# system prompt tells ADAM to reply in the language the user just spoke, so one
# mis-detected fragment makes ADAM abandon Hindi mid-conversation.
#
# Naming the two languages actually in use collapses that search space. Keep
# this list SHORT — every extra entry re-widens exactly the confusion it is
# meant to remove, so add a language only when someone really speaks it.
# Hinglish (Hindi/English code-switching) needs no third code; it is covered by

# louder (and closer to clipping); +1 to the shift HALVES the level.
#
# S32_SHIFT=16 is the native 32-to-16 bit downshift (divide by 65536). It provides
# a quiet ambient noise floor (~300-600 RMS) and +25 dB clean headroom so speech
# never clips or distorts, preserving vowel and consonant formants.

# ── SPEAKER SOFTWARE GAIN ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Multiplier applied to Gemini's TTS before playback. THIS is the fix for "the
# speaker gain is changing constantly and so much noise now, a few minutes back it
# was crystal clear quality — it sounds like the gain increases from low to mid
# where it was working perfectly, then goes high where it has lots of noise".
#
# Nothing in ADAM ramps the output level: this is a constant, and the volume tools
# in laptop_agent_client.py drive the LAPTOP, not this speaker. What varies is the
# CONTENT. Gemini's TTS already peaks around -3 to -1 dBFS, so a 1.3 multiplier put
# loud syllables 10-30% PAST int16 full scale while quiet and mid-level passages
# stayed inside it. Everything under the ceiling reproduced cleanly; everything
# over it was saturated. That is why the distortion came and went with how loud
# the sentence was, and why it sounded like a gain rising into noise.
#
# Measured on the Pi, THD of a 1 kHz tone through the real playback chain at
# gain 1.3, sweeping the soft-limiter knee (see SPEAKER_LIMITER_KNEE):
#     input FS   x1.3    hard clip   knee0.90   knee0.95   knee0.98
#       0.60     0.78       0.002%     0.002%     0.002%     0.002%

# The lesson is in the last three rows: once the signal is over the ceiling, EVERY
# way of getting rid of the excess costs 4-10% THD. Soft limiting is a wash — it
# only ever recovered ~0.2 points, well inside the noise. There is no clever way to
# reproduce a waveform that does not fit; the only cure is not to exceed the
# ceiling. At gain 1.0 Gemini's own samples cannot exceed full scale by
# construction, and THD drops to the ~0.002% floor of the resampler.
#
# The cost is real and worth stating plainly: 1.0 is 2.3 dB quieter than 1.3, and
# there is no hardware volume to make it up with. `amixer -c sndrpigooglevoi
# scontrols` AND `controls` both return nothing on this card — zero mixer
# controls, simple or raw — so this multiplier is the only loudness knob ADAM has,
# and loudness trades directly against distortion. If clean-but-quiet is the wrong
# trade for the room:
#   echo 'SPEAKER_GAIN=1.15' >> ~/adam/.env  &&  sudo systemctl restart adam
# 1.15 puts the ceiling at 0.87 FS, so only genuinely loud syllables saturate.

# slope matches the linear region exactly at the knee — nothing to hear at the
# transition.
#
# Per the sweep above this is a BACKSTOP, not the cure — it buys ~0.2 THD points
# where hard clipping was already destroying the waveform. It is kept because it
# is cheap (1.4 ms per 20 ms chunk, ~7% of realtime on a Pi Zero 2 W) and because
# it removes flat tops entirely (measured: 7,000-11,000 flat-topped samples per

# nothing), because it compressed everything above the knee instead of only what

# opened the VAD gate on ADAM's own voice. Sending that back to Gemini is how a
# model starts answering itself.
#
# The fix is a raised OPEN threshold for a short window after the mic reopens —
# not a longer mute. The audio keeps flowing into the pre-roll buffer either way,
# so nothing is thrown away; it just takes a genuinely louder chunk to be called
# speech.
#
# The MULTIPLIER is tied to MIC_SILENCE_FLOOR and to the echo level, and BOTH

# speaker interpolator and the SPEAKER_GAIN retune cut the tail by more than

# level rises far above its own quiet baseline when someone talks. A channel
# that is dead — unpopulated mic, cold joint, or an I2S data line left
# floating during its word slot — is stationary, because bus noise does not
# care about the room.
#
# So liveness is measured per channel as the dynamic range of its own
# first-difference RMS over a rolling window: 20*log10(p99/p20). The first
# difference is used because it costs one vector op, removes DC entirely
# (this HAT's left channel carries a large DC offset) and emphasises the
# 2-8 kHz band the decision actually matters for.
#
# Measured on this unit, silence vs loud speech through its own speaker:
#     L  baseline 9.1e6  peak 2.2e8  ->  +27.9 dB   LIVE
#     R  baseline 1.6e8  peak 1.9e8  ->   +1.7 dB   DEAD
# A 26 dB separation, so the 8 dB threshold below is nowhere near either
# population. Nothing here is a room constant: every number is that
# channel's own statistic.
#
# The verdict is STICKY per channel — a channel that has proven it hears is
# not un-proven by a quiet room — and it is persisted, so only the very first
# run on a new unit pays for the learning window. It is undone only on
# RELATIVE evidence: a channel that goes quiet while the other one is
# responding has failed, whereas both going quiet is just a quiet room and
# changes nothing. So repairing the dead mic promotes "auto" back to mixing
# within one utterance, and a mic that dies in the field drops out by itself.

# learned value opens the test up — worth real capture, because speech at low
# SNR is itself flatter than clean speech: the noise fills the spectral
# valleys between the harmonics this statistic exists to see. In a TONAL room
# (a whine, a hum) the bed's flatness can be LOWER than speech's, and a
# two-sided rule would walk the threshold down until nothing passed at all.
# The floor makes that unreachable: worst case is exactly today's behaviour.

#
# That swap is the fix for "ADAM talks but never hears me". Raw S32 RMS reads
# 68M-108M in a SILENT room on this hardware, ~40x over the old 2_000_000
# floor, so the silence gate and the adaptive noise-floor gate below it could
# never fire: every chunk of pure room noise was forwarded, Gemini received one
# unbroken noise bed, and its turn detection never found a speech onset or
# endpoint. Post-filter these numbers track actual speech.
#

#   * the original numbers ("quiet room 1,580-1,900") were taken while the neck
#     servo held its 50 Hz pulse train forever after a move, so the mic heard
#     coil whine in every "quiet room" sample, AND while the noise trackers were
#     poisoning themselves. Both are fixed now (hardware.py detaches the pin;
#     see MIC_NOISE_LEARN_COOLDOWN_S for the loop).
#   * the replacement numbers came from the live journal's rate-limited "Mic RMS"
#     lines — only n=42 over 100 s — and read p50 773 / p99 1,027. A direct
#     600-chunk measurement through the identical path does NOT reproduce that.

#     servo energised (holding)     p50 4,658-4,666   max 5,299

#
# So the usable window is 1,405 (worst idle p99) to 2,357 (quietest measured

# floor is placed at the geometric midpoint, sqrt(1405*2357) = 1,820 -> 1,800:
# equidistant in dB from the noise and from the speech, which is the only
# defensible split when both sides are measured and neither can be moved.
#
# Why not the 2,300 it was: 2,300 sits ABOVE most real speech chunks. It only
# caught the loud peaks, so the journal showed five
# "Speech detected"/"Speech ended" pairs in 100 s and ZERO transcripts — no open
# run ever lasted long enough for Gemini to find both an onset and an endpoint.

# ── VAD HYSTERESIS / HANGOVER / PRE-ROLL ────────────────────────────────────
# A per-chunk "is this chunk louder than the gate?" test cannot pass speech
# through intact, no matter how well the threshold is tuned. Speech is not a
# continuous plateau: it has stops, unvoiced consonants and inter-word gaps that
# fall to near the noise floor. In the measured capture, mid-sentence chunks read
# 1,776 / 1,913 / 2,008 sandwiched between 3,860 and 3,895. A plain threshold
# punches holes at exactly those points, so Gemini receives shredded fragments
# with the gaps deleted, finds no coherent onset/endpoint, and returns no
# transcript at all — which is precisely what was observed.
#
# Those dip readings come from a session whose room floor was higher than the
# 1,039-1,245 measured later, so treat them as an UPPER bound on the dips: a dip
# in a quiet moment goes lower, not higher. Either way the requirement is the
# same and it is what the two constants below deliver — a dip must not close the
# gate, whether because it stays above hold_th (1,475 at settled trackers, so
# the as-measured dips clear it) or because it is shorter than the hangover
# (which covers the quieter dips that do not).
#
# The standard fix, and what these three constants implement:
#   RELEASE_RATIO — two thresholds instead of one. Opening the gate needs the
#       full margin; STAYING open only needs this fraction of it. Classic
#       Schmitt-trigger hysteresis, so mid-word dips don't slam the gate.
#   HOLD_MARGIN   — a FLOOR under both thresholds, expressed as a multiple of
#       the tracked NOISE PEAK (session.py keeps a decaying maximum of the
#       non-speech chunks alongside the average). RELEASE_RATIO alone is not
#       safe: 2300 * 0.72 = 1,656, which is BELOW this room's measured quiet
#       range of 1,450-1,990. A hold threshold under the noise floor means every
#       chunk of silence re-arms the hangover, so the gate LATCHES OPEN and
#       streams a continuous noise bed. Observed live: the gate opened at 2,447,
#       held on 1,674 / 1,930 / 1,770 (all pure room noise), and stayed open
#       ~40s — and Gemini answered that noise with hallucinated transcripts in
#       random languages ("안녕하세요", "luego").
#       Against the PEAK rather than the average on purpose: the average is
#       biased low by design (fast-fall/slow-rise, so speech cannot poison it),
#       so it settles near the quiet end of the noise and under-reads the peaks
#       that actually trip the gate. 1.05 clears the measured 1,990 peak at
#       ~2,090 while leaving a real 2,090-2,300 hysteresis gap below open_th.
#   MAX_OPEN_S    — latch watchdog. The noise trackers freeze while the gate is
#       open (speech must not teach them what silence sounds like), so a latched
#       gate is self-sustaining: no update, no threshold movement, no escape.
#       If nothing has re-cleared the OPEN threshold for this long, whatever is
#       holding the gate is not speech — force it shut and resync the estimates
#       up to the level that fooled them. 15s exceeds any single conversational
#       utterance, so it never truncates real speech.
#   HANGOVER_S    — after level finally drops below the release threshold, keep
#       forwarding for this long. Covers gaps between words and the trailing
#       unvoiced consonant that endpointers otherwise clip ("cats" -> "cat").
#       This is load-bearing, not a nicety: the measured mid-word dips (1,776 /
#       1,913 / 2,008) fall INSIDE the quiet-room range, so no level threshold
#       can tell a dip from silence. Only a DURATION test can, which is exactly
#       what the hangover is.
#   PREROLL_S     — onset is only detectable AFTER it has begun, so by the time
#       a chunk clears the threshold the word's attack is already in the
#       previous chunks. Keep a small ring buffer and flush it on open;
#       otherwise "hello" arrives as "ello" and wrecks recognition.

# The median sat 1631-1705, BELOW hold≥1731 — the level test wanted to release.

# 10-25% of noise chunks clear hold_th, i.e. one every 0.13-0.33s, and each one

#   • intra-word stops in connected speech are 50-150ms, 1.5-4.5 chunks, so they

# (1.67x vs 1.68x usable window, -0.1 dB): once the sub-100 Hz rumble is gone
# the remaining noise is broadband hiss sitting on the speech band, so there
# is nothing left to filter. Threshold tuning and spectral filtering are both
# exhausted at ~4.5 dB of separation.
#
# What that measurement did find: under a 300-3400 band-pass the noise p50
# fell 30% while the p99 fell only 17%. Stationary noise moves both equally.
# A tail that survives band-limiting and sits 1.67x above its own median is
# IMPULSIVE — clicks, creaks, taps, servo bearing ticks. Those are 1-2 chunks
# long; the shortest useful utterance is tens of chunks. So requiring N
# consecutive chunks separates them on a dimension where the gap is enormous
# instead of on level, where it is 4.5 dB.
#
# The cost is zero audio: MIC_VAD_PREROLL_S (0.8s = ~24 chunks) of history is
# already buffered and flushed on open, so N chunks delays the DECISION, not
# the speech. Even 5 chunks = 167 ms sits comfortably inside that 0.8 s.

#
# ── WHY "CONSECUTIVE" WAS WRONG, AND WHAT REPLACED IT ───────────────────────
# The 0.0 false opens/min above is real. The "capture cost is only the onset"
# is not, and the reason is a flaw in how it was measured: the simulated
# positives were SUSTAINED SYNTHETIC VOWELS. Real speech is not. "Hey ADAM"
# is /h/ — aspiration, broadband, flatness near 1.0, fails the shape test on
# its own merits — then a vowel, then the /d/ STOP CLOSURE, which is 50-80 ms
# of near-silence, i.e. 2-3 whole chunks BELOW the level threshold. Both are
# speech; neither passes; and under a consecutive rule either one resets the
# counter to zero. The gate then wants 5 clean chunks in a row that ordinary
# English does not contain at conversational level, so `blocked` climbs, and

# The duration test is still the right idea — it is what rejects impulses on

# last MIC_VAD_ONSET_WINDOW chunks, in any order, gaps allowed.
#
# 3 of 6 (200 ms) is the default, and it costs nothing in false opens because
# the two votes multiply. In the measured room a chunk clears the level
# threshold 12.9% of the time and the shape test 4.3%; independent, that is
# 0.55% per chunk, and the chance of 3 such chunks landing inside any 6-chunk
# window is ~3e-6, i.e. of order 0.01 false opens/min — below the 0.0/min the
# consecutive rule measured only because that number was already at the floor
# of what 25 s can resolve (±2.4/min). What the quorum buys back is the whole
# class of real utterances the run test was silently discarding.

#
# This is the fix for the actual root cause of "ADAM cannot hear me", measured
# by adam/_amphiss.py through the live capture path, one variable, reversible:
#
#     aplay closed            p50 1082  p99 1519    0% of chunks over the floor
#     aplay open on SILENCE   p50 1726  p99 2163   37% of chunks over the floor
#     aplay closed again      p50 1341  p99 1719    0%
#
# +4.1 dB of noise, produced by ADAM itself. The voiceHAT's class-D amplifier
# idles by switching, and holding the playback device open keeps that switching
# noise coupling into two microphones sitting inches away on the same PCB. It
# is not the room: killing aplay puts the floor back.
#
# What it cost: the quietest real speech ever measured on this unit is 2357,
# so the usable speech-to-noise window collapses from 1.55x to 1.09x — from
# "tight" to "nothing". With 37% of silent chunks over MIC_SILENCE_FLOOR the
# gate latches open on hiss, and the live journal showed exactly that: `sent
# 301` of ~300 chunks per 10s window, i.e. an unbroken wall of noise streamed
# to Gemini, with the 45s hard watchdog firing on silence. A real sentence
# arriving inside that stream has no onset to segment, which is why the
# transcripts were multilingual garbage rather than simply absent.
#
# Raising MIC_SILENCE_FLOOR above the hiss was never an option: it would have
# to go above 2163 (p99) to stop the false opens, and real speech starts at
# 2357 with mid-word dips down to 1776. Removing the noise is the only move
# that leaves any window at all.
#
# The cost of closing the device is one aplay spawn (~50-100ms on a Pi Zero 2 W)
# before the first audio of a reply. That is hidden by the model's own
# time-to-first-audio, and it is paid only after real idleness — never
# mid-sentence (gated on adam_speaking), never during a song (gated on
# song_playing), and never before the drain deadline set by end_of_turn().
# 2.5s is comfortably past the ~0.5s ALSA buffer drain.
#
# THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS TRADE, and the reason for the escape hatch below: the
# voiceHAT is ONE I2S device serving capture and playback, so every teardown is
# a chance for the capture DMA to be left running but delivering zeros (see
# MIC_DEAD_STREAM_S). Closing after every reply turned a once-per-session race
# into a once-per-turn one. There are two mitigations in the code — the
# teardown is graceful (EOF, not SIGTERM) and listen() detects the wedge and
# respawns arecord — but on a unit where the wedge is chronic, the way out is
# to stop tearing the device down at all:
#
#     SPEAKER_IDLE_CLOSE_S=0     → never close; hold the device for the
#                                  session, as ADAM did before this constant
#
# That costs the +4 dB of amp hiss above, permanently. It is survivable now in
# a way it was not when this comment was first written, because the gate no
# longer trusts level alone: the learned floor simply settles onto the hissier
# bed (observe() is skipped only while the amp is HOT, so a permanently-open
# device is learned as the room it now is), and the shape vote rejects hiss on
# its merits — broadband switching noise reads flatness ~1.0 against a 0.35
# limit. Expect reduced sensitivity to quiet speech, not deafness. Prefer the
# default; reach for 0 only if "Capture DEAD" keeps appearing in the journal.

# could show the median but never the tail — and the tail is what opens the gate.
# Every constant above was calibrated with adam.service stopped (the diagnostics
# need the capture device to themselves), so the distribution UNDER LOAD, with

# Re-measured on this build with adam.service stopped (adam/_floorcal.py and

# VAD gates on:
#
#     servo never pulsed        p50 1,039-1,245  p99 1,304-1,405
#     servo attached, holding   p50 4,658-4,666  max 5,299   <- 3.7x, above open_th
#     0-1s after detach()       p50 1,697        max 3,582   <- STILL noisy

#
# open_th is 1,800, so a holding servo alone pins the gate open. That is the
# whole "ADAM talks but can't hear me" failure: at boot the servo is detached and
# the mic floor is ~1,100, then the first head gesture (or DOA turn, or idle

# OPEN, so every extra second is a second in which ADAM cannot notice someone
# starting to talk. 2.0 covers both bad seconds (p50 1,697 then 1,931, max
# 3,582); the residual after that is ~1,400, within 10% of baseline and harmless
