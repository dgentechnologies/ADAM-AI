hardware.py — ADAM v40 servo & display actuators
==============================================================================
Thin actuator layer. Two physical output paths:

  • Pan servo — driven DIRECTLY by the Pi via gpiozero on GPIO 12 (hardware
    PWM). Initialized once at import; if gpiozero/pigpio isn't available the
    handle stays None and servo_pan() becomes a safe no-op (audio-only mode).
    Auto-DETACHES NECK_SERVO_HOLD_S after each move — see servo_pan() for the
    measurement that made that mandatory, and `servo_moving` for the event the
    audio path uses to ignore the mic while the head is actually turning.
  • Tilt servo + TFT face — driven INDIRECTLY: the Pi sends "TILT:<deg>" /
    "EMO:<emotion>" text lines over the UART to the ESP32-CAM, which relays
    them on to the Pico. So servo_tilt() and tft_set() are just esp_link
    sends, not GPIO.

Wiring constants (GPIO pin, pulse widths) come from config.py, verbatim from
the working build. tft_set() is the canonical definition; session re-exports
it so `from session import tft_set` keeps working for main.py.

    The release is not an optimisation, it is an audio fix. gpiozero holds the

    energised and vibrates the board carrying both INMP441s. Re-measured with
    adam/_floorcal.py and adam/_servodecay.py, in the same post-filter RMS units
    the VAD gates on: p50 1,039-1,245 with the servo never pulsed, 4,658-4,666

    1,697 then 1,931 in the two seconds AFTER detach, before it returns to
    baseline. The gate opens at 1,800, so a holding servo alone pins it open
    forever, which is exactly how "ADAM speaks but never hears me" started:
    detached at boot (working), then the first head gesture attached it and the
    noise floor quadrupled for the rest of the session.

    Each call restarts the timer, so a burst of moves (DOA tracking, a gesture
    sequence) is one continuous hold followed by a single release, never a
    release part-way through the travel. A move arriving during the post-detach
    settle window also cancels that window's timer, so the flag stays set
    continuously instead of dropping between two nearby moves.
